This is LPN [https://mdelapenya.github.io/lpn/index.html](https://mdelapenya.github.io/lpn/index.html), a CLI that makes it easy running Liferay Portal's Docker images.

It wraps Docker commands so you just have to run this tool, and pass the specific tag you want to run.

## Requirements

You have to install Docker on your machine first. Check [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/install).

## Installation

For current stable version of `lpn`, please visit [downloads page](https://github.com/mdelapenya/lpn/releases), and select the target platform, based on O.S. and architecture.

If you are in the Golang world, you could install this tool from source code.

For that reason you need to:

  - [Install Golang runtime](https://golang.org/doc/install)
  - Make sure that you have `GOPATH` environment variable defined to the location you want to have your Golang projects
  - Add `$GOPATH\bin` to your `$PATH`, like this: `export PATH=${PATH}:${GOPATH//://bin:}/bin`
  - Clone this repo under `$GOPATH`: `git clone https://github.com/mdelapenya/lpn $GOPATH/src/github.com/mdelapenya/lpn`
  - From inside the project, run `go install`

Now you can use `lpn` from your command line.

## Tool Configuration

`lpn` uses a configuration file in YAML format for the values that could be modified by end-users, like the container names, or the images to be used with each type.

If the configuration file is not present at `$HOME/.lpn/config.yml`, `lpn` will create it the first time it is run.

An example of default values are:

```yml
container:
  names:
    db:
      ce: db-ce
      commerce: db-commerce
      dxp: db-dxp
      nightly: db-nightly
      release: db-release
    portal:
      ce: lpn-ce
      commerce: lpn-commerce
      dxp: lpn-dxp
      nightly: lpn-nightly
      release: lpn-release
images:
  portal:
    ce:
      image: liferay/portal
      tag: 7.0.6-ga7
    commerce:
      image: liferay/commerce
      tag: 1.1.1
    dxp:
      image: liferay/dxp
      tag: 7.0.10.8
    nightly:
      image: mdelapenya/portal-snapshot
      tag: latest
    release:
      image: mdelapenya/liferay-portal
      tag: latest
```

A use case of overriding this configuration would be if you would like to update `lpn` to use a different tag on CE runs. Then, please go to the configuration file and update the proper key:

```yml
[...]
images:
  portal:
    ce:
      image: liferay/portal
      tag: 7.1.2-ga3
[...]
```

### Tools logs
The CLI uses [`Logrus`](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) as default Logger, so it's possible to configure the logger using [Logging levels](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus#level-logging) to enrich the output of the tool.

To set the log level, please set the environment variable `LPN_LOG_LEVEL` to one of the following values, being `INFO` the default one:

```shell
$ export LPN_LOG_LEVEL=TRACE
$ export LPN_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
$ export LPN_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
$ export LPN_LOG_LEVEL=WARNING
$ export LPN_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR
$ export LPN_LOG_LEVEL=FATAL
$ export LPN_LOG_LEVEL=PANIC
```

It's also possible to add current timestamp to each log line. To do so, please set the environment variable `LPN_LOG_INCLUDE_TIMESTAMP`, with "true" (case-insensitive).

```shell
$ export LPN_LOG_INCLUDE_TIMESTAMP=TRUE
$ export LPN_LOG_INCLUDE_TIMESTAMP=true
```

## What does lpn do?

With `lpn` you'll be able to:

  - Run Liferay Portal containers using the released version you prefer:
    - Liferay Portal official images, obtained from [here for CE](https://hub.docker.com/r/liferay/portal/tags/) and [here for DXP](https://hub.docker.com/r/liferay/dxp/tags/).
    - Liferay Portal nightly builds, obtained from [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/mdelapenya/portal-snapshot/tags/).
    - Liferay Portal releases, obtained from [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/mdelapenya/liferay-portal/tags/).
    - Liferay Portal including specific products, like Commerce.
  - Run a real database to store portal data
  - Deploy applications to the running containers:
    - Imagine a developer gives you a non-released JAR/WAR file to test it. You could deploy and test it in seconds!
  - Check logs of the running containers
  - And more!

## Usage

The available capabilities present in the tool are the following:

  - Run a container from the desired Liferay Portal/DXP image.
  - Configure a Liferay Portal/DXP container to be run alongside a real database.
  - Configure a Liferay Portal/DXP container to be run using a custom portal-ext configuration file.
  - Deploy a file or the content of a directory to the deploy folder of a Liferay Portal/DXP running container.
  - Display logs of a Liferay Portal/DXP running container.
  - Pull Liferay Portal/DXP images on demand.
  - List the available tags to pull from the Docker Hub repository of a Liferay Portal/DXP image.
  - Check if a Liferay Portal/DXP image was already pulled.
  - Check if a container of the desired Liferay Portal/DXP image is running.
  - Stop a Liferay Portal/DXP running container, and possibly all its dependant services, like a database.
  - Remove a Liferay Portal/DXP running container.
  - Remove a Liferay Portal/DXP image from your local Docker installation.
  - Open a Liferay Portal/DXP running container in the default browser.

### Which are the available commands?

Execute `lpn help` to see the list of available commands. Each command could have subcommands, so append the `help` command to each subcommand and you'll get a list of options for each one.

This could be an example of how the `help` subcommand shows:

```shell
$ lpn help
A Fast and Flexible CLI for managing Liferay Portal's Docker images
				built with ❤️ by mdelapenya and friends in Go.

Usage:
  lpn [flags]
  lpn [command]

Available Commands:
  checkc        Checks if there is a container created by lpn (Liferay Portal Nook)
  checki        Checks if the proper Liferay Portal image has been pulled by lpn (Liferay Portal Nook)
  deploy         Deploys a file to Liferay Portal's deploy folder in the container run by lpn
  help           Help about any command
  license        Print the license of lpn
  log            Displays logs for the Liferay Portal instance
  pull           Pulls a Liferay Portal Docker image
  rm             Removes the Liferay Portal instance
  run            Runs a Liferay Portal instance
  start          Starts the Liferay Portal instance
  stop           Stops the Liferay Portal instance
  update         Updates lpn (Liferay Portal Nook) to the latest version
  version        Print the version number of lpn (Liferay Portal Nook)

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for lpn

Use "lpn [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Once you have typed the proper command, to specify with which image type you want to execute the command, there are the following subcommands:

  - ce
  - dxp
  - release
  - nightly
  - commerce

So any command needs the combination of one of the subcommands above. So to run a DXP image, you would need to execute `lpn run dxp`.

## Running a container from a Liferay Portal/DXP image

It will run the desired image, pulling it first if it does not exist in your local Docker installation. To specify which image type you want to run, please select it adding the `ce`, `dxp`, `release`, `nightly`, `commerce` subcommands.

You will be able to configure in which state you want to run the image, using the following flags:

| Flag | Description |
|:-|:-|
| ` -d, --debug` | Enables debug mode. (default false) |
| ` -D, --debugPort` | Sets the debug port of Liferay Portal's bundle. It only applies if debug mode is enabled (default 9000) |
| ` -g, --gogoPort` | Sets the GoGo Shell port of Liferay Portal's bundle. (default 11311) |
| ` -p, --httpPort` | Sets the HTTP port of Liferay Portal's bundle. (default 8080) |
| ` -m, --memory` | Sets the memory for the JVM memory configuration of Liferay Portal's bundle. (default "-Xmx2048m" in the CE and DXP images, and "2048m" in the rest) |
| ` -P, --properties` | Sets the location of a portal-ext properties files to configure the running instance of Liferay Portal's bundle. |
| ` -s, --datastore` | Sets the default store type for the portal (default hsql). If the `storeType` command is different than "hsql", then lpn will try to spin up a container for the datastore, connected to the running portal instance. Available datastores are: **hsql**, **mysql** and **postgresql**.
 |
| ` -t, --tag` | Sets the image tag to run |

Examples:
```shell
$ lpn run ce -t "7.1.1-ga2"
